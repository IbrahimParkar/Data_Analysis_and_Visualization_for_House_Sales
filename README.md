date: Date the house was sold
price: Sale price of the house (prediction target)
bedrooms: Number of bedrooms
bathrooms: Number of bathrooms
sqft_living: Square footage of the home
sqft_lot: Square footage of the lot
floors: Total floors (levels) in the house
waterfront: Indicates if the house has a view to a waterfront
view: Indicates if the house has been viewed
condition: Overall condition of the house
grade: Overall grade given to the housing unit based on the King County grading system

# Project Highlights
1. Analyzed and visualized various aspects of the house sales data, including price distribution, bedroom and bathroom counts, square footage of homes and lots, house conditions, grades, and more.
2. Utilized popular libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and scikit-learn for data manipulation, visualization, and modeling.
3. Explored correlations between different features and the house sale price.
4. Built and evaluated linear regression models to predict house prices based on different features.
